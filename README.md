#Sunday Adventure

Sunday Adventure gives you three options of things to do within walking distance of your current location. You cannot get a new set of activities until you have completed the one you've selected. This app uses the Foursquare API, Rails and Boostrap. This app was built in 10 hours during the 3rd Annual DBC Hackathon and won first place!
